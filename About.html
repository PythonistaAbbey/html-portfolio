            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>Hello! I’m Abiodun Musa Mustapha, a seasoned Molecular Biologist and Data Analyst based in Riyadh, Saudi
                Arabia. With a Master’s degree in Molecular Biology from Stockholm University and a minor in Data
                Analysis, my career spans over a decade of impactful work in microbiology and biomedical informatics. I
                have honed my skills in data mining, machine learning, and programming, making significant contributions
                to both academic research and industry applications.
            </p>
            <p>My professional journey includes roles such as a Data Engineer at Meta (Facebook), where I organized and
                analyzed complex data sets, and a Biomedical Informatics Researcher at Stockholm University, where I
                applied AI and deep learning to predict disease spread and treatment responses. Currently, I teach
                Advanced Placement and IB Biology at Maarif Education, nurturing the next generation of scientists and
                bioinformaticians.</p>
